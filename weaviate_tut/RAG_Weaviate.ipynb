The regions in the northeast of the\\nNetherlands, roughly the provinces of Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland north of the great rivers are the\\nleast populated areas of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is\\ngenerally known for its many kinds of meats.
